# ARDUINO-BASED-MEDICINE-REMINDER
Mini Project
By connecting the USB cable to Arduino board and write code in the Arduino software then the device activates. The Pill reminder alarm is powered by using 5V supply. 
When it first boots up, it shows a welcome message as “Welcome to Pill remainder”.  The LCD screen is set to three screens. The first screen shows message as “Stay Healthy, Get well soon”. The second screen is a help screen which tells to press select push button to select any one time-slot to remind (once/twice/thrice in a day). The time slot is changeable in program and can be configured accordingly.
Right now we have fixed this into three duration i.e., 8am, 2pm and 8pm. When the time matches with the selected slot, the buzzer starts buzzing along with the LED’s indicating which set (tray) of medicines the person should have. User can stop buzzer by using the STOP push button. This process repeats for the next cycle
